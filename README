Overview
--------

This repository contains a formalization of IEEE floating point numbers.
First, we formalize fixed point numbers so we can model IEEE subnormal
numbers (in fixed.hl and fixed_thms.hl). Next, we formalize
`generalized' floating point numbers to model IEEE normal numbers
(in float.hl and float_thms.hl; Cf. John Harrison's work and the Coq
formalization). Finally, we piece the two formalizations together to
formalize IEEE (ieee.hl and ieee_thms.hl).

In the process, we needed a formalization and basic theorems for raising
real numbers to an integer power; this is in common.hl.

IEEE floating point numbers are treated as a subset of the real numbers.
We can model mostly everything except signed zero and NaNs.

Usage

To load the theorems and formalizations, load make.hl after loading base
